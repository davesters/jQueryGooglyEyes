jQueryGooglyEyes
================

Make eye contact with your DOM elements so you always know where you stand with them.

Slap some Googly Eyes on a single element, or give anything a class of googlyeyes and it will do the work for you.

    $('element').googlyEyes(options);

    $.googlyEyes(options); // Will put Googly Eyes on any element with a class of googlyeyes

Simple as that.  There are some options available:

**eye_size** - The pixel diameter of the eyes.

**iris_size** - The pixel diameter of the iris.
